# Qwen Adapter V0 Artifacts

This directory contains the first real Qwen adapter-training gate for the
Track 1 practical loop.

The adapter is intentionally narrow:

- model: Qwen3-8B Q4_K_M
- base inference path: generated QK policy with `QK_PRIMITIVE_STORAGE=shared`
- adapter: output-head LoRA only, rank `4`, alpha `8`
- training data: `bench/qwen-rollout-20260612/training-data-v1/sft.jsonl`

Artifacts:

- `8b-output-lora-r4/README.md`: adapter training summary and saved adapter.
- `8b-output-lora-r4/adapter.json`: adapter config.
- `8b-output-lora-r4/adapter.npz`: adapter tensors.
- `8b-output-lora-r4-rollout/summary.md`: 75-prompt rollout with adapter loaded.
- `compare-8b-base-vs-output-lora/report.md`: deterministic base-vs-adapter
  comparison.

Current result:

- adapter weights changed: L2 delta `0.003541`
- train/eval loss was already saturated on self-generated rows and stayed
  saturated
- adapter rollout quality: `75/75`
- base vs adapter: `0` regressions, `0/75` text changes, `0/75` token changes
- eval-loop speed ratio: `0.5925` vs base generated rollout

This proves adapter install, save/load, rollout, comparison, and contract
plumbing. It does not prove Qwen quality improvement. The training data is
self-distilled from the base model, so it has almost no supervised loss signal
for this output-head adapter.
